# Policy

Goal: Enable users to apply policy to Apex nodes. Traffic patterns continue to transition from North/South to East/West.
This upending of traffic flows has driven disaggregation of firewalls to host based or segmented traffic filtering.
Currently, platforms such as Kube, Openstack, Cloud Service Providers, proprietary ZTN/SASE solutions are either tightly 
coupled to the platform. The ability to offer ACLs/Security Groups on all Apex nodes allows for a baseline policy to
be applied homogeneously across platform, cloud providers and enterprise data centers.
